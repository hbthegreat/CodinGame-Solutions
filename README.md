CodinGame Solutions
===

Currently just the solutions of CodinGame challenges that I have completed. Will update progressively whenever I have additional time to do more challenges over on http://www.codingame.com.

The solutions below currently use C# although I look to recomplete them with many other languages in the future.

_**Disclaimer**: These are actual solutions to some of the problems on CodinGame so if you wish to solve the questions yourself then you should probably stop reading to avoid ruining it for yourself!._
